# Type
Is a set of values and the things you can do with them

Example: Boolean type is the set of all booleans (true and false) and the operations you can perform on them (||, && and !)

# Type literal
Is a type that represents a single value and nothing else

```ts 
const a = true; // type -> true (value from subset of boolean)
const msg = "ola" // type -> "ola" (value from subset of string)
```
